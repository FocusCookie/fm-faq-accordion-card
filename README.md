## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- ::before & ::after
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The positioning of the cube, card background and illustration was a littlebit tricky because the card should not let overflow the background. Only the cube should overflow.
